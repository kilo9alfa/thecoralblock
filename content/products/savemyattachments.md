# Save My Attachments

**Problem we are addressing - How to process emails and their attachments automatically, from Gmail into Google Sheets**

SaveMyAttachments is a Google Workspace Add-on that automatically processes your Gmail emails, saves attachments to Google Drive, logs email data to Google Sheets, and generates AI-powered summaries of the emails received.

You wil have in an spreadsheet all relevant emails and attachments that you care for, correctly classified and be able to share them with your team mates and collaborators. 

## Key Features

### 📧 Multiple Workflow Rules
Create unlimited rules for different email types (invoices, receipts, clients, etc.). Each rule can have its own Gmail filter, destination folder, sheet, and AI prompt.

### 🤖 AI-Powered Summaries
Get intelligent email summaries using 200+ AI models through OpenRouter. You control costs by bringing your own API key.

### 📁 Smart Organization
Save emails and attachments to organized folders in Google Drive with support for Shared Drives.

### 📊 Searchable Index
All email data logged in Google Sheets with clickable links, making your emails searchable and queryable.

### 🎯 Flexible Filtering
Use Gmail search syntax to target specific emails. Process only what matters to you.

### ⚙️ Catch-All Mode
Process unmatched emails with default settings, or only process emails matching specific rules.

## How It Works

1. **Configure Settings**: Set up your OpenRouter API key, Google Drive folder, and AI model preferences
2. **Create Rules**: Define workflow rules with Gmail filters (e.g., "from:client@company.com has:attachment")
3. **Process Emails**: Run manually or automatically every 15-30 minutes
4. **Access Organized Data**: Find everything in your Google Sheet with links to Drive files

## Pricing

Available on the Google Workspace Marketplace with subscription pricing.

- **Subscription Fee**: Covers the add-on and support
